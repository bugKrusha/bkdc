I am Jazbo, an artifact of my mother's upbringing, and my environment's fortification.  

I write about science, HAI, Apple platform engineering, and the philosophies that haunt me.

I write for those who know curiosity invites discomfort—and choose to sit in it anyway.  
I write for me. The words on this page are demons in my mind.  
I write for those for whom discovery is a journey—not a fixed destination.  
I write for those willing to grapple; willing to grow.  
I write for those bold enough to walk unworn paths.
