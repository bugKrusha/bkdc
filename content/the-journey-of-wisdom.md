As a child, I had this affinity for reading non-fiction. My favorite was [Modern Ways to Health](https://www.amazon.com/Modern-ways-health-Clifford-Anderson/dp/B0007C4B10), a pair of encyclopedias my mom kept in the house. This is where I first learned that the fallopian tubes have no physical connection to the ovaries[^1], yet the reproductive system finds a way to deliver eggs across that gap every month—flabbergasted.

I am not sure if these encyclopedias led to or merely sustained my fascination with biological systems, but I knew early on that I wanted to study medicine, and I learned a lot from these books. I spent the better part of 18 years pursuing that destination.

In 2012 that pursuit was no longer viable and I needed a pivot. I couldn't afford to spend any of my emotional or mental bandwidth on grappling with the need for the pivot—all of it had to be spent on the pivot itself, the fulcrum being a 2012, 4GB RAM, 128GB SSD MacBook Air. 

I had an iPhone—at the time, it was the coolest thing I had ever touched, so I thought it would be cool to make apps for it[^2]. I learned Swift when it dropped in 2014 and shipped an app to the Store in 2015. In 2016, [Cate](https://cate.blog) delivered my resume to the amazing people at Glowforge[^3]. I interviewed and landed a job. That changed my life.

I worked at Glowforge for four years, and left for a tvOS job at Apple in Cupertino in 2020. That changed my life.

The pandemic delayed the move and my son asked me if we could stay in Seattle. 

Apple was great, so I found an internal role that allowed me to stay. It was in the Human–Computer Interaction group focused on AI technologies. My manager left after a year. I switched research teams.

When I started in research in 2021, I didn’t take the initiative to understand the research incentive structure. I stuck to what I knew—traditional engineering—building prototypes for researchers without stepping deeply into research myself[^4].

I asked my new research manager if I could transition to research, a role that typically requires a PhD and experience publishing at top venues. He said *that would be very hard to do, but you have my full support[^5]. He handed me a Python Notebook with a project and said *this is yours.* 

I called it Athena.

It was just accepted at [IUI](https://iui.acm.org/2026/).

It's my first, first-author paper. 

Some things don't just change your life, they change its trajectory. This feels like one for me.

But this isn't about me. It is about you.

As a child in Jamaica, I took the same path through the valley where we had fruit trees—oranges, avocado, rose apple, mangos. In the third grade I busted my face falling from a [Cacao tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theobroma_cacao). I walked about a half a mile back home screaming for mom[^6], eye bloody, on that path. 

I went back home last week and that path wasn't there—the path I spent 20 years traversing was gone. But you know what was present? The fruit trees. The path had changed, but the destination remained intact. The big [Number 11 mango tree](https://www.jamaicaoceanviewvilla.com/the-best-jamaican-mangoes-a-definitive-guide/) is still one of the primary drivers in that ecosystem[^8].

Destinations exist before any path to them is formalized. A fruit tree does not need a trail to bear fruit. People find it, they walk to it, and the walking _becomes_ the path. Over time, the path hardens—not because it is the best route, but because it is the most traveled one. Repetition does more to maintain a path than its actual merit does.

And building a path always means destroying something[^7]. You flatten what was there before. Because building involves personal and organizational goals and requires compromise, any path that gets built will serve some people more than others. Inequity isn't a bug—it's baked into the structure.

Traditional paths are very important. Some are well-paved, time-tested, and have produced extraordinary practitioners—many of whom I deeply respect and can now call co-authors. 

By themselves, these paths aren’t the problem. Insisting that they are the _only_ way to reach a destination is.

I need to be frank.

There are people whose identity is so intertwined with the path they took, if you arrive by another path, it doesn't just surprise them—it threatens something fundamental about how they see themselves. There are people who bemoan inequities with the left side of their mouths, while clinging to the very infrastructure that enables these inequities with the right side of their jaw. Some of them are from the institutions that guard the gates. Some of the people trying to get in are from where I am from.

I don't say this to start a war, but pull up if you have a sick jumper.

I say it because the people I'm writing this for—the ones on the winding road, the ones who had to start over, the ones staring at a MacBook Air wondering if this is really going to work—they need to hear something other than _that's not how it's done._

Structural barriers are real. Not everyone can access the traditional path. Money, geography, timing, circumstance—these are not excuses, they are facts. And the existence of these barriers means that nontraditional paths are not a lesser alternative. They are a necessary one. They can produce practitioners every bit as rigorous, every bit as capable, as any other route.

Your journey is yours.

Just like the fallopian tube and its ovarian neighbors, paths that don't connect in a traditional sense can still deliver outcomes.

Never let anyone tell you what you can and cannot do. The constraints are real—but so is your agency within them. Don't let anyone tell you that the path they took is the only one that's viable.

I can't wait to see where you go.

If you have ever walked those specific valleys carved by the great [Rio Minho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Minho) and its tributaries, the Building Apps with Athena section in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20263) is specifically for you.

[^1]: Anatomically, the ovary releases the egg into the open cavity of the abdomen. Finger-like projections at the end of the fallopian tube then sweep it up and guide it inside. There is no sealed conduit between ovary and tube.
[^2]: More on this at a later time.
[^3]: I loved my time Glowforge. The problems were interesting, the tech was cool, the people were cooler.
[^4]: This is a fumble that I still grapple with. I will say more later.
[^5]: I can't overstate my gratitude. _This role requires a PhD_ could have legitimately shut this conversation down.
[^6]: As a child, I was fascinated by height so I climbed the tallest of trees, for work or fun. I frequently hurt myself, and frequently had to scream for my mom.
[^7]: _What was here before?_ is a question we don't ask enough.
[^8]: I can't find an official cultivar for this but the info on the linked page is pretty good.
